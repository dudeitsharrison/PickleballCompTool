How to use:

Type names separated by commas or returns, and click "add players".
Select number of courts, click "Let's Play Pickle!" and generate first teams for the first rounds. 
Fill in the scores, submit each round, and move to the next round.
At any point, user can check current stats/winners using "Show Podium".
Users may also check match history using the match history button.
All data may be deleted and reset for another match, though user must click "clear all match data". This was put in place for cases where a user would swipe up too far when scrolling through matches and accidentally reloaded the page.

Also, on the Podium stats, user can change each player's statistics if needed.


How it works:
Each round created prioritises players that have not played together yet, have played against opponents the least amouont/same amount as others, and if players have just sat out or not. This results in round robin making effective pairings to avoid duplicate matchups in teammates or opponents as much as possible, while also giving everyone similar play time/opportunities for matches.

Enjoy! Updates are randomly pushed when I have time. ;)
