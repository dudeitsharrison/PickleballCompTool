Tool is opened via index.html file.

How to use:

Type names separated by commas or returns, and click "add players".
Select number of courts, click "Start Tournament" and generate first teams for the first rounds. Any players not included in a match will be "sat out" and prioritized next round.

Fill in the scores, submit each round, and move to the next round automatically.

At any point, user can check current stats/winners using "Leaderboard" or the small floating trophy button.

Users may also check match history using the match history button.

Both the Leaderboard and the Match History panels can save a photo of the entire table

All data may be deleted and reset for another match, though user must click "clear all match data". This was put in place for cases where a user would swipe up too far when scrolling through matches and accidentally reloaded the page or exit the page accidentally, or for simply saving battery on a mobile device.

Also, on the Podium stats, user can change each player's statistics if needed via the edit button.


How it works:
Each round created prioritises players that have not played together yet, have played against opponents the least times/same amount as others, and if players have just sat out or not. This results in a round robin style matchmaking, having effective pairings to avoid duplicate matchups in teammates or opponents as much as possible, while also giving everyone similar play time/opportunities for matches.

This does mean that it will sometimes at moments have a player sit out more often than others if they have more games played due to some players being manually sat out or players joining late.

There are some bugs but I'm hoping to fix these and please feel free to report bugs in the app as well once that feature is added. Thanks and happy Pickling!

Enjoy! Updates are randomly pushed when I have time. ;)
